        <h4 style="display:inline"></h4>T<h5 style="display:inline">here are so many things to love about this bread recipe, but if I 
            had to highlight the best parts, it's that it only requires shelf stable ingredients (no milk, eggs or butter needed!) and 
            it's EASY and fool-proof to make! Whether you're a newbie or experienced bread maker, you can't mess this up, and I know you're 
            going to love it (~3h45 to get ready!)</h5>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4 style="display:inline">Warm water: (105-115 degrees)- to activate the yeast</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Active Dry yeast</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Granulated sugar or honey</li>
            <li><h4>Salt: to enhance flavor <img align="right" src="../food_img/pauzao.png" alt="homemade bread cute" height="150" width="150"></h4></h4></li>
            <li><h4>Oil</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Flour</h4></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4 style="display:inline"> In a large bowl or stand mixer add the yeast, water and a pinch of the sugar or honey. 
                Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes until foaming and bubbly</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Add remaining sugar or honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour. Mix to combine. Add another cup of flour and mix to combine. 
                With the mixer running add more flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Mix the dough for 5 minutes on medium speed (or knead with your hands on a lightly floured surface, for 5-8 minutes)</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Grease a large bowl with oil or cooking spray and place the dough inside. Cover with a dish towel or plastic wrap and allow to 
                rise in a warm place* until doubled in size (about 1 ½ hours)</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Punch the dough down really well to remove air bubbles and divide into two equal portions</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Spray two pieces of plastic wrap with cooking spray and lay them gently over the pans. Allow dough to rise again for about 
                45 minutes to one hour, or until risen 1 inch above the loaf pans</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Adjust oven racks to lower/middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake bread for about 30-33 minutes, or until golden 
                brown on top. Give the top of a loaf a gentle tap; it should sound hollow.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Invert the baked loaves onto a wire cooling rack. Brush the tops with butter and allow to cool for at least 15 
                minutes before slicing.</h4></li>
        </ol>
